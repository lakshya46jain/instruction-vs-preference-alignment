This has 3 datasets. 
The first one is our dataset for the pre cleaned and pre processed model dataset named alpaca_data.json
The second dataset is for our Instruction tuning dataset named code_alpaca_20k.json
The third one is the cleaned version of the second dataset named cleaned_data.json
For further work you have to use alpaca_data.json and cleaned_data.json for the Project.
